The programs engaged in this document were chosen as favorites (or in some cases, relics) of Collum group members.  There is a large emphasis on those that are open source and free to use (**listed in bold below**), however there are a plethora of alternatives available across the internet and the following list should be taken as a starting point, not a superlative.

### You'll need the following programs for this tutuorial:
  
SFTP client (e.g. **FileZilla**, **putty**)  
Molecular modeling program (e.g. GaussView, **Avogadro**, SAMSON, etc...)  
Command line terminal (e.g. the built in **terminal** on Linux/Mac OS or **cygwin** if you're using a Windows machine)  
A text editor (e.g. **Brackets**, **Sublime**, **VSCode**, **Vim**, **Notepad++**, etc...)  
3D-rendering/ray-tracing software, optional (e.g. **CYLView**, SAMSON, etc)
