This page is not done yet, how did you even get here?

In *the Short Course* we never really talked about what <kbd>Gaussian</kbd> is actually doing when you ask it for an optimization. Not knowing what goes on under the hood/in the server room doesn't hurt you; in fact, its actually a very good thing that you don't need to know how a program works to use it.

Of course, it can sometimes be quite helpful to know a little bit about how a task is implemented, e.g., setting up the correct calculations, selecting the right options, troubleshooting difficult convergence cases, and understanding error messages. So in this section we'll explain what exactly happens when you run an optimization in <kbd>Gaussian</kbd> and how you can use the various keyword options to fine tune the process.

### The potential energy surface

### Coordinate systems

### The Berny Algorithm

### Energy calculation using the SCF procedure
