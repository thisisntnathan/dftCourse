<h3 id="the-short-course">The Short Course</h3>

<p>The <em>Short Course</em> is designed as a primer for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. It is intended to give the completely inexperienced reader a step-by-step guide to running electronic structure calculations on the AS-CHEM computing cluster at Cornell University, but it is our hope that these instructions are easily generalizable to other computing clusters.</p>

<p>The <em>Long Course</em> is a set of more advanced topics in scripting and computational chemistry. It was written for those who have, or would like to, incorporate more advanced calculations/models into their research. The topics start by the computational streamlining workflow (with <kbd>bash</kbd> scripting) and then progress towards the more under-the-hood options of computational engines.</p>

<p>Using <kbd>bash</kbd> to streamline computational workflow and data processing<br />
Cost efficiency: Selecting basis sets and functionals without going overboard<br />
Using custom basis sets and pseudopotentials<br />
The <del>science</del> art of finding transition structures<br />
Transition structure search using QST methods<br />
The implicit/explicit solvation war<br />
Electronic structure theory

<h3 id="problems">Problems</h3>

<p>My least favorite math teacher would always say that the only way to learn calculus is to solve lots of calculus problems. This is a collection of case studies and practice problems that you can use to try your own hand at computational chemistry.</p>

<p>The <em>International Journal of Quantum Chemistry</em> has published an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1097461x">excellent series of tutorial reviews</a> for novices and professionals alike. I highly recommend looking through them. Below are a few you may find particularly helpful.</p>
