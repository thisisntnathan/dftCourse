# The DFT course

So your advisor has finally found those [cool](https://doi.org/10.1039/D0CC06085B) [looking](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg0720) [reaction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.1c03797) [coordinate](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c02193) [diagrams](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1010603021000964) and wants you to start checking out this DFT thing so that you can get your next paper into the hallowed halls of *Science* or *Nature*. Well, you're in luck! [This course](thisisntnathan.github.io/dftCourse) should get you started off swimmingly.  

This course was designed with Cornell chemistry students as its principle audience. It centers around how to use the AS-CHEM cluster and <kbd>Gaussian</kbd> (<kbd>Psi4</kbd> instruction coming soon!), but we hope that it will be helpful (particularly the Long Course) for those outside Cornell chemistry too.

## Acknowledgements

The DFT course was born from a document that's been passed down by members of the Collum Group at Cornell Chemistry since we started using DFT calculations to supplement our research on the mechanics of organolithium and organosodium chemistry. In this sense the all group members have had an impact on it, after all *we see further because we stand on the shoulders of giants* (and prior grad students).  

## So you want to contribute?

If you want to contribute to this course (first of all, thank you!), or you have suggestions on how to make it better, you have two options: 1) [contribute to this project](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/) on GitHub, or if you're unfamiliar with Git 2) [email me](mailto:nml64@cornell.edu) and we can figure something out!
